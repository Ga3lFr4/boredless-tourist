# boredless-tourist
Hello,

This is one of the first projects I worked on following the Codecademy Computer Science course. It was made using Python and git for version management.

The objective of the program is to return to a traveler a list of attractions he might be interested in depending on where he is and what he is interested in

Still not used to commenting everything, so if there's any feedback you'd want to give me feel free to reach out
